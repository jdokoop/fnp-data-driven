Ana Code:    /offline/analysis/HFAnalysis/IsolationSurivalRate/CalcSurvivalRate
CVS Version: 1.4

Notes: - Scale factor set to double, instead of int
       - Using original + new set of simulations (2000 x (5000 + 8000) = 10M events)
       - Cocktail particles sampled uniformly between [0, 18] GeV/c
       - New version of ana code saves both reweighted and non-reweighted electrons
